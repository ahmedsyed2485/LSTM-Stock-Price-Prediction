# LSTM-Stock-Price-Prediction
Our project seeks to address the Stock Price Prediction challenged posed by the TAMU Datathon team. We were motivated to apply Long Short-Term Memory neural networks to time series analysis of stock indicators.

Our project receives data about the stock indicators of a particular stock, and predicts the opening price of the stock the next day, off of which it bases automated stock trading decisions.


## Conclusion
This project was a part of the TAMU Datathon. After submitting our project, the TAMU Datathon team then applied our model to their example. After buying $1000, we ended up making $1400.
